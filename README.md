# Hybrid cloud migration phases

     a. Assessment (application, infrastructure, performance assessment)
     
     b. Mobile & mapping (digital asset invectory, application, infrastructure, perfomance discovery mapping, landing zone, vending machine product, migration                 readiness assessment(MRA)  
     
     c. Migration(7R) & modernation (Retain, Retie, relocate, rehost, replatform, repurchase, refactor)
