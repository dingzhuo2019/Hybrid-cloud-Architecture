# Hybrid cloud migration phases

     a. Assessment (application, infrastructure, performance assessment)
     
     b. Mobile & mapping (digital asset invectory, application, infrastructure, perfomance discovery mapping, landing zone, vending machine product, migration                 readiness assessment(MRA)  
     
     c. Migration(7R) & modernation (Retain, Retie, relocate, rehost, replatform, repurchase, refactor)

 13. Serverless architecture 
  
  
  
  
  1.  Organization, Account, Service control policy
  
      AWS:   (organization, structure, cross account, IAM Account roles and permission policy: Service control policy, STS, permission boundary, advanced setting:                   cross account management, RAM, shared VPC)
      
      AZURE: (tenants, organization, Azure AD user, groups Account policy permission RBAC, conditional access policy, identity privilege management)

  2. Cloud user group IAM, Federal SSO
  
       AWS:   (SAML2.0, federal sso/Cognito, workspace, hybrid directory service, AD connector, hybrid AD)
       
       AZURE: (SAML2.0, federated sso, Azure directory service, AD domain service, identity governance, AD security and health check, Azure AD connector, hybrid AD,                  privilege user identity protection,Azure AD, AD conditional Access, Connect Health, AD Domain Service, Privilege Identity, Identity governance)

        Note: Federated SSO solution use MS-AD and AFDS to have two-way forest trust is the key solution for multi-cloud strategy. 
               

  3. Networking 
  
       AWS:   (Region/AZs/subnets, public/private VPC, IGW, NATGW, security VPC, management VPC, transit VPC, NACL, SG, BGP, S2S VPN, Directconnect, DXGW, VGW, TGW,                  pubic/private/tranit VIF, GW & interface end-point, Route53 & Hybrid DNS, AWS private link)

      AWS security strategy and architecture 

     1. top down security design
     
        1.1 secure the organization
        
        1.2 secure the ogranization OU
        
        1.3 Secure the account
        
        1.4 Secure the network

        1.1 Secure the orgnization & OU: use security Hub, control tower, SCP, SSO, Cloudtrail, Firewall Manager, IAM advisor, etc
   
        1.3 Secure the account level: use SCP, cloudtrail, AWS config, System Manager, Guardduty, Inspector, Security Hub, IAM access advisor and cloudwatch

        1.3 Secure the network : use inspector, WAF, shield, FW, FW manager, ACM, SG, NACL, GW, VPC endpoints, endpoint policy, flow logs, traffic monitoring


    2. AWS compliance and assurance

        Four layers of compliance and assurance
        layer 1: AWS config set up the standard compliance rules, collect the aggregated account config data, update the AWS security hub, control torwe, and backup 
        
        layer 2: Sydtem manager do the image and patch management, pre-built the image for the VM/container
        
        Layer 3: AWS auditing Manager integrate with cloudtrail, provided pre-built automatic generated compliance reports for auditing
        
        layer 4: AWS conformation-guard provide the guardrail for the code check before the resource provision. 


        Best Practice of the security design

        1. IdP with federated SSO with IAM, SCP 
        2. Enable the traceability 
        3. Apply security at all layers
        4. Automate security best practice as much as possible
        5. Pretent Data in transit and rest
        6. keep the data away from human-System manager and configure manager
        7. Security event automation 
        8. security hub built-in compliance PCI-DSS, use it. Security hub integrated with guardduty, inspector, miace, IAM access analyzer, firewall manager, central              view
        9. KMS and CloudHSM for key management
        10. SCP deny permit deny rules on the organization to control the resource creation, together with IAM and resource based policy 
        11. always use session manager/SSM as default for private VPC instance access
        12. deny the S3 and other resource public access
        13. enable the auto backup
